it's easy to use first you need to instal these dependencies

- Node.js http://nodejs.org/
- Bower http://bower.io/
- Grunt http://gruntjs.com/getting-started

Enter in console to the main project file, example:

cd C:/main or cd /var/html/main

when you are into the main file execute the follow commands:

npm install (for install the nodejs dependencies and grunt packages)
bower install (for install the bower components for to develop)

Finally execute the last command

grunt server

this command is executed for activate the grunt tasks, for to import and order the bower dependencies, minifying css and js files, develop with live overload and other tasks in advance.

Thanks.
