# Getting started

it's easy to use first you need to instal the follow

- Node.js http://nodejs.org/
- Bower http://bower.io/
- Grunt http://gruntjs.com/getting-started

Enter with your console to the main project file, example:

<code>
cd C:/main or cd /var/html/main
</code>


when you are into the main file execute the follow commands:

- npm install (for install the nodejs dependencies and grunt packages)
- bower install (for install the bower components for to develop)

Finally execute the grunt task

<code>
grunt swam
</code>


this command is executed for activate the grunt tasks, for to import and order the bower dependencies, minifying css and js files, develop with live overload and other tasks in advance.

Thanks.
